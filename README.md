# Linux_Configurations
### Brief comments on the files
ZathuraRC that is the configuration of the current PDF viewer alongside VimTeX which I use.

sxhkdRC is the "Simple X Hotkey Daemon" configuration where in no way I can configure the volume keys. Maybe someone else's github might help (\?)

bspwmRC is the "Binary Space Partition Window Manager" config (I had to literally spend 10 mins to find the full form). I like a little space between windows. And also, the zathura is configured to be a "Window" not a "Floating one", and it took me superb amount of work and thinking to figure out that single line code from reddit.

picom is what makes my windows opaque or blur. Fun thing is the Picom configuration misbehaved when set, so I just bought an example .conf file from Compton github repo (which is the older version of picom) and put that. It works perfect, and the code is shorter than picom's so I could study it and configure a bit like I wanted.

why would I bother to commit the greatest mistake without adding the vimrc file. The Primeagen makes a video on it literally every year. And I tried understanding this whole stuff long before getting Linux, couldn't find the vimrc there, after finding it in some directory then being introduced it was read-only; nice memories.

.Xresources makes the ugly default urxvt look cool. 

And all of these codes have been found after searching it in different websites, I am thankful of all the minds who worked out the codes and made it online for beginners like me to use. I look forward to acknowledge all of the links as soon as possible.

### The Software the files Run on
